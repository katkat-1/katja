    <h2>HELLO LOVIE</h2>
    <p> Hi Kris,<br><br><span class = "indent"> This is our seventh monthsarry of being together. This past few months we've been thru a lot. But of course, we're strong and always fighting for our relationship. I remember when you asked me if we're still not together and I said yes, because you didn't even asked me clearly that you wanted to court me. And also I said that I won't be saying yes to you if I'm not 18, but guess what? You waited, waited for me to become 18 years old and waited to be my girlfriend. And you know that I always appreciate you? Since your love to me is always seen by the others, you're so transparent that you're in love with me. And I'm so happy, that they know me. Your family, friends, especially your mother, you know that I'm getting scared whenever I hear her hahahaha I don't want to know that she doesn't like me, but surprisingly I hope that she likes me. You know it's kinda surprising that we come from this far, since from the beginning I just wanted to play? I don't know if your lucky or unlucky that I invited you, probably you're happy since you're my boyfriend right now. For the last time, happy motmot, my love. Always remember that I love you, and missing you always. I hope that we can meet already, I'm here always waiting for you. </span>

I know that the reason is you having a tight schedule with school and games. And I understand it all, I don't want to be hindrance to your path to where you want to bloom."></textarea>
